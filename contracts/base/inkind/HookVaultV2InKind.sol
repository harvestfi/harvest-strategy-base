/**
 * @title HookVaultV2InKind
 * @dev `HookVaultV2` extended with governance-gated in-kind redemptions.
 *
 * While enabled, a holder can burn their vault shares and receive their pro-rata slice of
 * the strategy's position tokens directly - the yield source's own ERC-20 shares - instead
 * of the underlying asset. That gives them an exit when the yield source has no redeemable
 * liquidity, alongside the normal withdrawal path, which keeps working throughout.
 *
 * The payout is a proportional split of the tokens actually held, so it never depends on
 * the vault's cached share price. It does depend on the cached price NOT being stale in
 * the other direction: minting at a stale price and immediately redeeming the true
 * pro-rata slice would capture unaccrued yield from the holders who stay. So while the
 * switch is on, every deposit and withdrawal syncs the strategy first and the ERC-4626
 * views quote at that same synced rate, so previews match execution exactly.
 *
 * This is the {HookVaultV2} flavour, for vaults that also use the withdrawal hook or the
 * deposit cap; {VaultV2InKind} is the plain-`VaultV2` equivalent. Both are drop-in
 * implementations for an existing proxy: the switch lives in its own hashed slot, is off
 * by default, and every inherited entrypoint is unchanged while it is off.
