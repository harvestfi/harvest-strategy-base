// The loss carry (high-water mark) follows the holders who leave.
//
// lossCarry is an absolute amount of underlying the position must earn back before a
// fee is charged again. It belongs to the holders who bore the loss. When some of them
// exit they take their share of the loss with them, so their share of the carry has to
// go too - left whole, the carry would shield a much smaller position, and anyone who
// deposits after, from the fee on genuinely new profit. Every exit path scales it: an
// in-kind exit by its exact share, a withdrawal through the vault by what leaves the
// strategy, a full withdrawal to zero.
