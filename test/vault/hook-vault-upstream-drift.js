/**
 * Upstream-drift guard for HookVaultV2.
 *
 * HookVaultV2._withdraw is a verbatim copy of VaultV1._withdraw with exactly two edits.
 * Solidity cannot enforce that. Measured: patching the *body* of VaultV1._withdraw
 * recompiles cleanly and leaves HookVaultV2's runtime bytecode BYTE-IDENTICAL, i.e. the
 * upstream change is silently dropped for every vault running the Hook implementation.
 * Only a signature change, or removal of `virtual`, fails loudly at compile time.
 *
 * This guard closes the silent gap. Pure source analysis: no fork, no compile, ~10ms.
 *   npx mocha test/vault/hook-vault-upstream-drift.js
